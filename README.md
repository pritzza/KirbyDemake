# SFML-Platformer

This is my first time doing anything with SFML by myself. The initial goal was to make a game along the lines of Kirby's Dreamland, but that proved to be way too ambitious.

Instead this has just turned into a much simpler attempt at a generic platformer to help me get my toes wet with SFML.
